Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had a powerhouse team. Incredibly proud of the time our team spent on day 1 to define our problems, solutions, and scope, from a user-centered design perspective. Team member Debby led the discussion, providing space for all team members to voice their opinions, iterate on ideas, as well as user experience and visual design of mobile app. Our developers worked around the clock and prioritized swiftly. We were extremely lucky to have Susan provide a strong industry perspective and direction around search, rescue, and triage. Helena provided invaluable sound engineering support, as well as a strong collaborator around UX.

What we learned
Hololens development.
